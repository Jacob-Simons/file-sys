//// My own rating on the functionality ///////////////////
Rating: B
Explanation: 
I think I have correctly implemented all File System commands and error checks.  Although, the only thing I'm not sure about
is whether I have correctly established my server's socket and shell's socket.  Both the server and shell can connect to
each other, but I think it may be only via local host.
